	Dear reader/developer:
	
	Seriously, who in their right mind decided that it was a good idea to make Iron Ore spit out post-forge processed scrap iron?
	Who, if anyone at all, was complaining about the logical workflow involving raw iron harvested from blocks?
	At what point was their complaint, if there was one, considered valid?
	
	I love the game you've got going here, but design decisions like this will ruin everything in a heartbeat. Be better.
